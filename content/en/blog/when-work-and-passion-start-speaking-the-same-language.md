When your day job and your hobby have nothing in common… but you somehow find a way to connect them - that’s when the real magic happens. ✨

💻 By day, I live in the world of technology - automation, cloud infrastructure, Kubernetes, DevOps pipelines, monitoring, reliability. A world built on logic, data and precision.

🐠 And after work, I dive (sometimes literally) into a completely different universe - aquariums, plants, coral reefs, ecosystems. A world driven by patience, observation, and balance.

At first glance, these two worlds couldn’t be more different. But the more I explore them, the more I see how similar they really are.

🔹 Monitoring: in tech, it’s CPU and memory. In an aquarium, it’s water chemistry.

🔹 Automation: here it’s Terraform and Helm; there it’s light timers and fertilizer dosing.

🔹 Stability: whether it’s a production cluster or a planted tank - balance is everything.

💡 One day, it clicked. What if these two passions could actually feed each other? What if technology could help me understand nature better - and nature could teach me how to build more resilient systems?

That’s how a small idea was born - a project that combines DevOps principles with natural systems, data with design, automation with life itself.

It started as a hobby… But slowly, it’s becoming something more - a creative bridge between what I do for a living and what I love doing most.

🌱 Because the truth is: you don’t have to choose between your job and your passion. When you connect them, you open the door to growth, creativity, and endless possibilities.

So if you’ve got a hobby that seems totally unrelated to your career - don’t ignore it. Nurture it. Explore it. It might just become the foundation for something amazing. 🚀

💬 What about you - have you ever found unexpected connections between your work and your passion?
