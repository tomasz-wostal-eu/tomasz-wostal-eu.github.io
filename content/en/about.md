intro: >-
  Hi! I'm Tomasz Wostal, a **Platform Infrastructure Manager** and **Software Architect** working in the **medical technology industry** at **Hemolens Diagnostics**. With over **10 years of expertise** in DevOps, Platform Infrastructure, and Automation, I lead technical teams and design distributed systems that power innovative medical diagnostics. My work focuses on **cardiology solutions**, combining **cloud-native architectures**, **microservices**, and **CI/CD automation** to deliver cutting-edge healthcare technology.

study: >-
  I hold a **Master of Science in Mechatronic Systems** from the University of Economy in Bydgoszcz (ongoing since 2015) and an **Associate of Science in Power Engineering**. Throughout my career, I've continuously expanded my expertise in **Kubernetes**, **cloud technologies** (AWS, Azure, GCP), **monitoring systems** (Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry), and **Infrastructure as Code** (Terraform, Crossplane, Ansible). I'm passionate about staying at the forefront of DevOps and platform engineering practices.

passion_title: "What I'm passionate about"
passion_text: >-
  I'm passionate about building **robust, scalable platforms** that enable teams to deliver high-quality software efficiently. As a **DevOps leader** with extensive experience across Finance, Government, and Medical Technology sectors, I specialize in designing **fully automated CI/CD pipelines** using tools like **Argo (CD, Events, Workflows, Rollouts)**, **Jenkins**, **GitLab CI**, and **TeamCity**. I believe in **Infrastructure as Code**, using **Terraform**, **Crossplane**, **Ansible**, and **Puppet** to create repeatable, maintainable infrastructure. My approach emphasizes **observability**, implementing comprehensive monitoring with **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, **Loki**, and **ELK/EFK** stacks to ensure platform reliability and performance.

mix: >-
  A key focus of my work is managing **complex platform infrastructures** in regulated environments. At Hemolens Diagnostics, I lead **four technical teams** (DevOps, Backend, QA, IT Support) and oversee **Continuous Deployment, Integration, Testing, and Observability** processes. I've designed **distributed systems** for **CFD and AI computations** running on **Kubernetes**, created documentation for **medical device certification** (EU, US), and implemented **microservices architectures** that support scientific research and clinical applications. My experience spans from **startup environments** to **enterprise-scale infrastructures**, always with a focus on automation, security, and scalability.

personal: >-
  Outside of work, I'm deeply passionate about **aquaristics** 🐠—both **freshwater planted tanks** with a focus on **aquatic botany** and **marine aquariums**. I also enjoy **home automation systems** 🏠 and **electronics/embedded systems**, where I combine my technical skills with hands-on experimentation. These hobbies often serve as testing grounds for new technologies and approaches that I later apply in my professional work.
